# Your Work
- All work should be from a `version` branch from `release`
    - Or a feature branch from the latest `version` branch
- Make sure to rebase your work off the `version` branch before opening a PR to merge back into `version`

# Pull Requests
- Merges should only come by way of PR's
- Only `version` branches should be merged (squashed) into `release` (through a PR)
- `version` branch will get deleted whenever it is merged into `release`
